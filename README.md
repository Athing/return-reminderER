*Being perfect is hard, but this application will make being perfect __less__ hard*

Addendum: Iterating through multiple checked out items has been tested, unfortunately due to Gmail eml formatting, I could not create a perfect solution with regex.

Testing instructions:
[Google Scripts](https://script.google.com) was used to write this. I haven't deployed this so manual execution of the script is required. I've attached the gs file: create a "new script" and copy-paste my code into there. Emails of the strict format of 
> Title: book title
> Barcode: barcode
> Due Date: mm/dd/yyyy,hh:mm
will be processed. 

[Contact me](mailto:17.davidwang@gmail.com) if there's any confusion about executing this script!
My hard drive is painfully loud in the background of the videos (sorry!)!
